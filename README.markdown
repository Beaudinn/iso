    My project is a lightweight isometric techniques in the modern web browsers without using a canvas, with only JavaScript and HTML CSS3. I make this project for my school as a final project of al my school years. Don't expect to see something amazing It will not be more than a trial project,. After all we have canvas with which people are releasing Quake Arena clones at 60fps.

I've only just started with scripting
and have to learn a lot and will doe this with this project.
